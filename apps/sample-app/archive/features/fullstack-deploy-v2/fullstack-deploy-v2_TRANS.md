Root cause: deploy-backend.yml Prepare deploy artifact step only packages @azure/functions dependency, but fn-demo-login.js has a runtime import of @branded/schemas (DemoLoginRequestSchema used for request validation). The compiled JS preserves this import. Fix: Either (1) add @branded/schemas + zod to the deploy package.json dependencies, or (2) switch backend build to esbuild bundling so all dependencies are inlined and no external packages are needed at deploy time. This also causes fn-hello to be unreachable because the function host reports 0 functions loaded / No HTTP routes mapped when any entry point file fails to import."}

{"fault_domain":"backend+infra","diagnostic_trace":"All 7 integration tests fail — every endpoint returns HTTP 404 (0 functions loaded on func-sample-app-001). Root cause: deploy-backend.yml Prepare deploy artifact step copies type: pkg.type into the deploy package.json, producing {\"type\":\"module\"} in the deployed artifact. But esbuild.config.mjs outputs format: \"cjs\" (CommonJS). Node.js sees type=module and tries to parse CJS files as ESM, failing with require-is-not-defined before the function host initializes (App Insights shows zero telemetry — crash happens pre-init). Fix: In .github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml, remove the line `type: pkg.type` from the Prepare deploy artifact step (line ~91 in committed code). An unstaged local fix already exists in the working tree but was never committed. The deploy package.json must NOT include type:module when esbuild outputs CJS. Additionally: backend package.json test:integration script uses deprecated --testPathPattern (should be --testPathPatterns for Jest 30+) — fixed locally. Failed tests: fn-hello(live): returns 200 default greeting (got 404), returns 200 custom greeting (got 404), returns 400 long name (got 404); fn-demo-login(live): returns 200 valid creds (got 404), returns 401 invalid creds (got 404), returns 400 missing fields (got 404), returns 400 invalid JSON (got 404)."}
