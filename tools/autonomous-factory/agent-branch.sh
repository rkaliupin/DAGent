# agent-branch.sh — Deterministic git branch management for agentic pipeline.
#
# Linear Feature-Branch Model: All work happens on a single feature/<slug>
# branch. The PR to the base branch is created as the final pipeline step.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/agent-branch.sh <command> <slug>
#
# Commands:
#   create-feature  <slug>  — Stash → base branch → pull → create/resume feature branch
#   push                    — Push current branch to origin (with retry)
#   cleanup                 — Prune stale feature branches
